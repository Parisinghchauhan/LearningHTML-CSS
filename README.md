# My HTML & CSS Learning Journey

Hi there!  I'm [your name], and I'm on a journey to learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. This repository is where I'll document my progress, experiment with different web design techniques, and build small projects along the way.

**About:**

* I'm starting from scratch with no prior experience.
* I'm aiming to create basic web pages with responsive layouts and interactive elements.
* I'm particularly interested in exploring CSS styling and animation.

**Project Structure:**

* The repository follows a simple structure with the following folders:
    * `html`: Contains HTML files for different projects.
    * `css`: Contains CSS files for styling.
    * `assets`: Optional folder for images, fonts, or other static resources.
    * `README.md`: This file you're reading!

**Technologies Used:**

* HTML5
* CSS3
* (Optionally, list any frameworks or libraries you're using)

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/html-css-learning.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred text editor or code IDE.
3. Launch your local development server (e.g., `npm start` if using a framework) or open the HTML file directly in your browser.
