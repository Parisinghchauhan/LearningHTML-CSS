# My HTML & CSS Learning Journey

Hi there!  I'm Pari Singh Chauhan, and I'm on a journey to learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. This repository is where I'll document my progress, experiment with different web design techniques, and build small projects along the way.

**About:**

* I'm starting from scratch with no prior experience in web dev.
* I'm aiming to create basic web pages with responsive layouts and interactive elements.
* I'm particularly interested in exploring CSS styling and animation.
